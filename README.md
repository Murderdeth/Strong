## Self betterment through honesty and voluntary hardship.

Document archive of physical improvement starting on my own in 2019 with “[Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training](https://aasgaardco.com/store/books-posters-dvd/books/starting-strength-basic-barbell-training/)” and then, more consistently, through [Barbell Logic Online Coaching](https://barbell-logic.com/), beginning in March of 2020. 

Video archive of almost all BLOC sessions has been uploaded to a playlist on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwZjFNG6K8CghLpWnKjasYYjpz8T11T1u).

Blog for mental improvement through prompts from [We’re Not Really Strangers](https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/), “[Self Reflection Pack](https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/collections/shop-all/products/self-reflection-edition-pack)” beginning in August of 2022 and their handwritten [Guided Journal](https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/collections/shop-all/products/wnrs-guided-journal) "[[Look Inside]]" starting in 2023.
